# What is design patterns?

Design patterns are a collection of reusable and tested solutions to recurring problems in engineering.
They make software more modular, maintainable, and extensible.

## Design patterns in Rust?

Rust is not object oriented language, and the combination of all its characteristics, such as functional elements, a strong type system, and the borrow checker, makes it unique.
Because of this, Rust design patterns vary with respect to other traditional object-oriented languages.

# Idioms

Are commonly used styles, guidlines and patterns largely agreed upon by the community.
Writing ideomatic code allows other devs to understand better the code.
KISS principle: "Keep It Simple, Stupid".
It claims that "most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. Simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unneccessary complexity should be avoided".
